# Gesticulate

_Gesticulate_ provides a structural representation of media types (previously known as MIME types),
representing their main type (e.g. `image`), subtype (e.g. `png`), suffixes (e.g. `+xml`) and
parameters (e.g. `charset=UTF-8`). It endorses the philosophy that impossible states should be
unrepresentable, which is contravened when media types are represented by strings.

## Features

- statically-checked representations of Media Types (a.k.a. MIME types)
- uses a `media""` string interpolator, e.g. `media"text/plain"`
- checks media types against the official IANA list at compiletime
- supports arbitrary custom `x-`-, `vnd.`- and `prs.`-prefixed types
- checks main media type (e.g. `text` or `image`), and suffixes (e.g. `+gzip` or `+json`)
- supports media type parameters such as `charset=UTF-8`


## Getting Started

## `MediaType`

Gesticulate primarily provides the `MediaType` type, consisting of:
 - a main "type" (called `group` to avoid a conflict with Scala's `type` keyword)
 - a subtype
 - a list of suffixes
 - a list of parameters, as key/value pairs

According to [RFC2046](https://www.iana.org/go/rfc2046), the main type must be one of an
enumerable list of ten types: `application`, `audio`, `image`, `message`, `multipart`, `text`,
`video`, `font`, `example` and `model`. These names are encoded (with capitalized initial letters)
in the enumeration, `Media.Group`.

The subtype may be a standard subtype, from IANA's [registered
list](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml), a vendor-specific subtype
(prefixed with `vnd.`) a "personal" subtype (prefixed with `prs.`) or a subtype prefixed with
`x.` or `x-`. The `Media.Subtype` enumeration distinguishes between these four categories.

Zero, one or more suffixes are allowed on any media type, of which 15 possibilities are currently
defined, including the common suffixes, `+xml`, `+json` and `+gzip`. These are enumerated in
`Media.Suffix`.

Parameters may be any key/value pair, and are represented as a `List[(String, String)]`, although
`charset` is the most common example.

The media type for XHTML, encoded as `UTF-8`, which would normally be written as
`application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8` may be represented as the case class instance,
```scala
MediaType(
  group = Media.Group.Application,
  subtype = Media.Subtype.Standard("xhtml"),
  suffixes = List(Media.Suffix.Xml),
  parameters = List("charset" -> "UTF-8")
)
```

However, this may be expressed as, `media"application/xhtml+xml; charset=UTF-8"`, and Gesticulate
will statically parse, check and destructure the type into the `MediaType` instance above.

`MediaType` reimplements `toString` to render a media type as a `String`, and additionally provides
the method `basic` to provide the media type with any parameters removed. This may be useful in
some comparisons.

## Checking Registered Types

Media types are checked against a recent copy of IANA's list of registered types, generated from the
lists [published online](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml), and
stored on the classpath at `/gesticulate/media.types`. This file is distributed with each published
release of Gesticulate, but may be supplanted by an alternative list appearing in the classpath. The
format for the file is a newline delimited list of media types including suffixes, but excluding
parameters.

## Parsing

Media types may be parsed using `MediaType.parse(string)` which returns a `MediaType` or throws an
`InvalidMediaTypeError`. The `InvalidMediaTypeError.Nature` type encodes different varieties of
parsing failure, should it be useful to distinguish between these.

## Status

Gesticulate is classified as __maturescent__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated
