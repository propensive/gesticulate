_Gesticulate_ provides a structural representation of media types (previously known as MIME types),
representing their main type (e.g. `image`), subtype (e.g. `png`), suffixes (e.g. `+xml`) and
parameters (e.g. `charset=UTF-8`). It endorses the philosophy that impossible states should be
unrepresentable, which is contravened when media types are represented by strings.
